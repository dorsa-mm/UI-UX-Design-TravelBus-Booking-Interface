Project Context / Background & Timeline:

This project aimed to create an intuitive travel booking system that simplifies the process of finding and reserving travel options for users with varying levels of technical expertise. The platform was designed as part of a hackathon-style initiative, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and error reduction. The project spanned 12 weeks, from brainstorming and prototyping to testing and delivering a polished, interactive platform.


Role and Responsibilities & Project Timeline:

Role:
Prototyped designs in Figma, conducted user testing, and implemented the platform in Visual Basic.

Weeks 10–11: Development:
Implemented the design into a functional platform using Visual Basic.
Week 12: Final Iteration and Delivery:
Addressed final user feedback and presented the completed project.


The Core Problem We were Solving (From a User’s Perspective):

Users face difficulty navigating traditional travel booking systems due to cluttered interfaces, inefficient navigation, and a lack of error-reducing features. The project sought to address these challenges by delivering a seamless, user-centered design with:
Simplified navigation.
Intuitive workflows.
Clear feedback mechanisms to minimize errors.


The Methods Used for Research – and Key Findings:

Primary Research:
User Testing: Conducted 5 rounds of usability testing with 10 external participants, including users of all experience.
Key Findings:
Participants preferred a streamlined navigation process.
Most errors stemmed from ambiguous button labels and unclear workflows.
Users valued visual consistency and accessible design.

Secondary Research:
Competitive Analysis: Analyzed existing travel booking platforms to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Key Findings:
Many platforms lacked clear error feedback.
Navigation paths were often overly complex, causing frustration.


Final Design Solution:

The travel booking platform featured:
A clean, intuitive interface: Prototyped in Figma with clear visual hierarchies and well-labeled buttons.
Streamlined workflows: Simplified navigation paths that reduced the steps needed to complete bookings by 30%.
Error-reducing design: Included clear error messages, undo functionality, and consistent feedback to users.
Implementation in Visual Basic: Delivered as a functional, interactive platform.

Impact:
Improved navigation efficiency by 30%.
Reduced user errors by 40%.


Reflection on What was Learned from the Project:

Importance of User-Centered Design: User feedback was crucial in shaping a design that met real-world needs. Iterating based on user testing ensured the final product was both efficient and accessible.
Collaboration Skills: Leading a team of 4 required clear communication, delegation, and facilitation of ideas, which enhanced teamwork and productivity.
Technical Growth: Implementing the design in Visual Basic deepened our understanding of bridging the gap between prototyping and functional development.
Iterative Design Value: The hackathon-style approach emphasized the importance of rapid iteration in response to user feedback.
